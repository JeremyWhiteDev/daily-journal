# Jeremy White's Daily Journal
An application to log, organize, and review short journal entries relating to a coding journey. 

### How to Use

Past journal entries can be reviewd by going to the "All Journal Entries" page. See Future Features for upcoming functionality.

To enter a journal entry, go to the section titles "Have you made your journal entry today?" and fill out the form, click the button "Record Journal Entry"

The sidebar consists of snippets of pinned journal entries. See Future Features for upcoming functionality.

### Future Features

The buttons in the navbar "happy" "sad" "curious" relate to the mood of different journal entries. When clicked, these will filter the All Journal Entries section to show only entries with those moods. The button will change style to show that it is active.

The All Journal Entries section will show 3 entries at a time, sorted by most recent. The section will be paginated and at the bottom of this section there will be something to the effect of: "< Back  Page 1, Page 2, Page 3, etc. Next >"

The edit button on a journal entry will bring up a popup inside the app when clicked with another form with the current journal entries fields prepopulated. Buttons on the bottoms will be "Save CHanges: and "Discard Changes"

The trash button on a journal entry will bring up a popup inside the app when clicked with with something to the effect of text requesting the user confirm the deletion and two buttons: "Yes, Delete this post" or "keep this post"

The Pinned Journal Entry cards in the side bar will when clicked, jump to that particacular entry in the All Journal Entries section.

Enjoy the app!
