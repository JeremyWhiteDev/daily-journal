The edit button on a journal entry brings up a popup inside the app with the current journal entries fields prepopulated. Simply click the "Cancel" button or click outside the pop-up to close the edit window. Click "Update Entry" button to save the canges to the DB.

The trash button on each entry will delete that entry. see Future Features for upcoming functionality.

The sidebar will consist of links for pinned posts. See Future Features for upcoming functionality.

This application comes with example entries. Use JSON-Server and "http://localhost:8000" to serve this example DB.

The entries can be filtered by mood or sorted by a number of options using the corresponding buttons and dropdowns in the all entries section.

### Future Features

The buttons in the navbar "happy" "sad" "curious" relate to the mood of different journal entries. These buttons will be replaced 

The All Journal Entries section will show 3 entries at a time, sorted by most recent. The section will be paginated and at the bottom of this section there will be something to the effect of: "< Back  Page 1, Page 2, Page 3, etc. Next >"

The trash button on a journal entry will bring up a popup inside the app when clicked with with something to the effect of text requesting the user confirm the deletion and two buttons: "Yes, Delete this post" or "keep this post"

The Pinned Journal Entry cards in the side bar will when clicked, display that current entry with options to editt or unpin it.
